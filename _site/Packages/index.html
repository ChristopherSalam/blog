    <p>Text Editors are a heated debate amongst programmers. It really comes down to choices of willingness to learn tools. I am intrigued to try all the different text editors out and develop a feel for what makes each special.</p>

<p>Some developer friends of mine use VI/VIM, or EMACS, but most tend to use <strong><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://Atom.io/">Atom</a></strong> text editor. I used Sublime (python, c and c++) but I am transitioning to <strong><a href="https://Atom.io/">Atom</a></strong> because I know it is built in javascript, and I can contribute more readily. I also am interested in using <strong><a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a></strong> to write programs for desktops.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a typical sublime layout.</p>

<p><image src="sublime.png"/></p>

<p>And here&#39;s a typical atom equivalent.</p>

<p><image src="atom.png"/></p>

<p>VIM and Emacs are two storied, old text editors that are powerful and purportedly more customizable, but my general experience with it involves cursing. One of my favorite ancedotes is my from my classmate <strong><a href="http://www.marcchristophe.com/">Marc</a></strong>, who uses <strong><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">EMACS</a></strong> religiously, and told me one day that he finally got a tree directory to work in EMACS (you can see both on the left above in Atom and Sublime, they come standard). <strong>YIKES!</strong></p>

<p>Here I&#39;m going to talk about <strong><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://Atom.io/">Atom</a></strong> packages. Here&#39;s a conceptual overview of some powerful things to install if you are starting to code. Install right now! Even if you don&#39;t learn all the possible ways to use the packages, they benefits they provide can be immediate. If you use Sublime and have not yet installed the package manager, please head to <strong><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/">here and follow the instructions on install now</a></strong>. Browsing the packages here is a great way to know what is trending and what people find helpful.</p>

<p>I use sublime linter with JSlint and JShint, which is pretty much several blog posts worth of difficulty, so I will pass on describing the process, but these are all helpful so consider installing them. Be patient, as each will take some time to install but is worth the struggle. After installing this, practice setting up different user accounts or save package json&#39;s with an established style guide (I use the AirBNB javascript guideline).</p>

<p>I use <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/max-mykhailenko/41d0c3991d92f38dcbc6">Emmet</a></strong> for HTML quick editing. <strong><a href="https://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom">Emmet</a></strong> is available in Atom as well.</p>

<p>With Emmet you can use control-e to convert abbreviations for HTML into the fully written html equivalent. The one I use most often is this one:</p>

<p><image src="emmet1.png"/></p>

<p>Great right? Other uses that are pretty common is to name divs with a specific class or id. This happens pretty quickly as well.</p>

<p><image src="emmet2.png"/></p>

<p>The uses can get very tricky. I don&#39;t use this one but I wanted to show it to you. You get the idea...</p>

<p><image src="emmet3.png"/></p>

<p>I use <strong><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitGutter"> Git Gutter </a></strong> to help me keep track of my changes visually. In Atom you can use <strong><a href="https://github.com/atom/git-diff">git-diff</a></strong>  to achieve this, it seems less customizable.</p>

<p>I use a <strong><a href-"http://jdlawrence.github.io/javascript/closures/2015/08/03/console-inside-sublime-text.html">sublime build tool </a></strong>, that my friend Jamil help me install to help me with my algorithmic problems. In Atom, this functionality comes from installing the <strong><a href="https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script">Script</a></strong> package, and using ⌘-i.</p>

<p>I use a <strong><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BracketHighlighter">bracket matching </a></strong> tool to help me keep track of the (), {}, and []. Something called Bracket Matcher comes standard with Atom.</p>

<p>I use <strong><a href="http://colorsublime.com/">color sublime</a></strong>, which keeps me from going crazy with the boring color pallette of text editing. In Atom and Sublime you can install themes from menus.</p>

<p>I use the a <strong><a href="http://logicmason.com/2013/strip-trailing-whitespace-every-time-you-save-a-file-in-sublime-text/"> white space removal </a></strong> tool I found at logic mason&#39;s website. Be sure to remove this setting from the markdown and other languages you use specific section of your sublime text, as white space is critically important in markdown and other languages. Atom comes standard with this package.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve fully switched over to <strong><a href="https://Atom.io/">Atom</a></strong>, but I&#39;ll leave this post up here for users of either text-editor. If you are interested in EMACS and Vim, I&#39;m sure enthusiasts out there have all the various packages made ready to go, but I&#39;m going to stick with modern editors. Hope this was helpful!</p>
