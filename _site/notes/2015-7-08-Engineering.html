    <!--Customer success roles? 

Become familiar with all problem with it. 

Getting bugs fixed. Helped me grow alot as an engineer. 

What is a typical day like?

Do you sprint?

What is the deployment like?

Their experiences with each.

What is good to hear when you ask these questions:

On average, quick turnaround on deploys. 

What's the relationship between you and the product manager?

How do you feel about working on the product here?

What's your favorite thing/least favorite thing that you'd done engineering wise at this company?

What were other places like: Felt out culture, aggressive. Cared about work life balance. I like to feel like I'm not just a cog in the machine. A couple place were just safety places. Laid out the pros and cons. Alot of the people I went to HR are on their third jobs. Grow as an engineer, grow as a person, and have work life balance. 

I look for someone drink the koolaid, passionate about what they do. Someone who knows what we do. What we do. Ideas? Good and bad are fine. I don't have to agree completely. These are the things that I like and these are my differences. Being a real honest person. Don't be a robot. 

Even as I'm evangelising this product, what continuing educational resources do I have access to. 

There have been parts I wish were different. During success - I was dedicated tech support. I'd be careful and interested in doing all the work I could. Under promise and over deliver. Working with people all across the company, if you can't set boundaries you will go under. 

Something that I'd wish I've known for building up engineers and developing your career. They should have a plan for developing you. If you ask someone that question and they don't have a good answer. Continuing education is a common thing companies are interested in. 

Currently Evangelism, his company is a data infrastructure rerouting and data processing company. After a year working there, he's been able to get the role they are interested in. 

Companies are individual on their approach to these roles, and you should ask the company going in to see if they are interested in supporting you and allowing you to grow into that role. What opportunities do you have here to grow? Have you grown here as an engineer? If they don't treat the engineers well, they will eventually leave, so they know to continually invest in their engineers or else risk losing their staff. 

Traditional engineering is something that I'm hopeful is on the way to dying. As someone who has spent time both in engineering school and as a working engineer, I think the mindset is small and the fact of the matter is that learning to work with automation and information sharing is the key to humanity's future. 

I am attending a software engineering bootcamp, primarily to learn the trade but also because I believe in the education model. I think that mutual investment, market demand, and connections force people adapt quickly and churn out people as useful products, and I hope this eventually becomes more representative of the education marketplace. There are numerous drawbacks to this, I understand the middle class is eroding very quickly in the United States, and the jobs of University staff and faculty are strong members of the middle class, another union being dissolved, but there simply is not enough accountability and responsivity to the market. 

I do think there is a powerful value to the education that I did obtain, I found some of my best friends, and I found and developed many of my passions: transportation, energy, the environment, agriculture, and complicated split-incentive problems. However, there really isn't a feedback mechanism for teaching us the most valuable skills and removing the classes that are filler and the professors that haven't kept up with the times. -->
