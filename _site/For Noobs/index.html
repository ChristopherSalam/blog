    <meta name="description" content="As a recent newb to computer programming, I have been told that the resources and links that I can provide or describe personally are of more value to other new programmers than those provided by expert or experienced programmers. I have spent hours staring at blogposts written by experts which are full or jargon, that make many assumptions about their reader&#39;s level of knowledge, and are unhelpful to people starting out. I have sent out these lists in email form to my friends who have approached me on the topic of getting started as a programmer, so here is a curated list for that hope to learn more!  One of the first and best steps to take is the sign up for the  Odin Project . This comprehensive guide goes through everything you will need to be a developer, including installing and using  rails ,  heroku , starting a  github account .   If this went well, I would recommend trying to work through  CodeAcademy , which teaches great tutorials for people starting a language for the first time.   I focused primarily on JavaScript, the language of the web, and found  JavaScript for Cats  to be helpful and concise. I then began reading  Eloquent JavaScript  as part of a process for applying for JavaScript specific bootcamps in the Bay Area. Another big part of the process was  Coderbyte challenges  and  JavaScript KOANS .   If you&#39;ve been able to absorb and complete most of this information, I&#39;d say you are probably ready to apply for a bootcamp. I told myself I needed more time, and proceeded to use paid resources before I would apply, but if you find these resources helpful enough, I think some people have been able to find work just by using these resources. I still have active accounts and use  Tree House  and  CodeSchool , which are very great to use together and for beginning frameworks and learning about dev tools. By the way, if all of this seems like a lot of different accounts, I will mention that I ended up using a password manager for the first time following this process.   In addition, reading has been helpful. I have read the Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja and other works by  John Resig , and have started on the tome of , but above all else, I highly recommend the  You Don&#39;t Know JS  series of books. They are really fun to read and they really understand the topic.   To also begin the process with HTML and CSS prowess, I would highly recommend setting up your own  personal website , (eventually websites for a portfolio) showcasing all the things you like and used to do before you decided to become a developer. The last thing I wanted to mention is try to find friends and mentors who have taken this path, and seek their advice. Hope this was helpful!
