        <title>Links For Newbs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a recent newb to computer programming, I have been told that the resources and links that I can provide or describe personally are of more value to other new programmers than those provided by expert or experienced programmers. I have spent hours staring at blogposts written by experts which are full or jargon, that make many assumptions about their reader&amp;#39;s level of knowledge, and are unhelpful to people starting out. I have sent out these lists in email form to my friends who have approached me on the topic of getting started as a programmer, so here is a curated list for that hope to learn more!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One of the first and best steps to take is the sign up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theodinproject.com/&quot;&gt; Odin Project &lt;/a&gt;. This comprehensive guide goes through everything you will need to be a developer, including installing and using &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt; rails &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com/&quot;&gt; heroku &lt;/a&gt;, starting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt; github account &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If this went well, I would recommend trying to work through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt; CodeAcademy &lt;/a&gt;, which teaches great tutorials for people starting a language for the first time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I focused primarily on JavaScript, the language of the web, and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsforcats.com/&quot;&gt; JavaScript for Cats &lt;/a&gt; to be helpful and concise. I then began reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://eloquentjavascript.net/&quot;&gt; Eloquent JavaScript &lt;/a&gt; as part of a process for applying for JavaScript specific bootcamps in the Bay Area. Another big part of the process was &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderbyte.com/&quot;&gt; Coderbyte challenges &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlaing.com/2010/07/19/learning-functional-javascript-through-koans/&quot;&gt; JavaScript KOANS &lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If you&amp;#39;ve been able to absorb and complete most of this information, I&amp;#39;d say you are probably ready to apply for a bootcamp. I told myself I needed more time, and proceeded to use paid resources before I would apply, but if you find these resources helpful enough, I think some people have been able to find work just by using these resources. I still have active accounts and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com&quot;&gt; Tree House &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeschool.com/&quot;&gt; CodeSchool &lt;/a&gt;, which are very great to use together and for beginning frameworks and learning about dev tools. By the way, if all of this seems like a lot of different accounts, I will mention that I ended up using a password manager for the first time following this process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In addition, reading has been helpful. I have read the Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja and other works by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/&quot;&gt; John Resig &lt;/a&gt;, and have started on the tome of &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.friendfeed-media.com/95a8434720c64a63e96ff8c4364fb595d9e98c36&quot; JavaScript for Web Developers &lt;/a&gt;, but above all else, I highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS&quot;&gt; You Don&amp;#39;t Know JS &lt;/a&gt; series of books. They are really fun to read and they really understand the topic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br/&gt; To also begin the process with HTML and CSS prowess, I would highly recommend setting up your own &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrissalam.com&quot;&gt; personal website &lt;/a&gt;, (eventually websites for a portfolio) showcasing all the things you like and used to do before you decided to become a developer. The last thing I wanted to mention is try to find friends and mentors who have taken this path, and seek their advice. Hope this was helpful!

        <title>First Post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very excited to get this blog up and running and write my first post! Today is an important day for many in our country, gay marriage was declared legal all over our country, by the U.S. supreme court. As someone with many LGBTQ friends and some family, I feel a deep connection and am proud that our country will allow any two kinds of people to receive the over 1,000 benefits that marriage bestows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I&amp;#39;m also about to embark upon a new chapter in my life, I&amp;#39;ve been unemployed and studying computer science diligently since being laid off from RCM Digesters, and starting on Monday, I will be attending &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraphacademy.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Telegraph Academy&lt;/a&gt;, which is a JavaScript focused web development accelerated course in Berkeley, CA. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This is one of the many coding bootcamps emerging in the Bay Area, but what makes mine different is that the school is most interested in training students who identify as people of color. I&amp;#39;m thrilled at the opportunity, and I&amp;#39;ve already met people whom I know will be great lifelong friends and collegues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I&amp;#39;ll be blogging here about things I learn about coding and general observations about software, engineering, building applications that harness my expertises, and my involvement in the development of a more representative workforce. Thanks for reading! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; June 26th, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
