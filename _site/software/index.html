    <meta name="description" content="I&#39;m pretty new to this game. It&#39;s been about 2 years. When people ask me how I arrived at this transition, I tell them that I was heavily inspired by learning Autocad at 28, and by my partner, Amy Yoshitsu, who&#39;s also transitioned from Art to Design/Developing. We saw an opportunity to help each other as well as possibly work together someday and it seemed too reasonable to pass up.
