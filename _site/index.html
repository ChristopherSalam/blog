      <div class="entry">
        <p>I&#39;m very excited to get this blog up and running and write my first post! Today is an important day for many in our country, gay marriage was declared legal all over our country, by the U.S. supreme court. As someone with many LGBTQ friends and some family, I feel a deep connection and am proud that our country will allow any two kinds of people to receive the over 1,000 benefits that marriage bestows. I generally dislike Justice Anthony Kennedy&#39;s opinions, but his final paragraph was moving and worth reposting. <br /> <br />
<img src="/images/Kennedy.png" alt="an image alt text" title="an image title"> <br /> I&#39;m also about to embark upon a new chapter in my life, I&#39;ve been unemployed and studying computer science diligently since being laid off from RCM Digesters, and starting on Monday, I will be attending <a href="http://www.telegraphacademy.com" target="_blank">Telegraph Academy</a>, which is a JavaScript focused web development accelerated course in Berkeley, CA. <br /> <br /> This is one of the many coding bootcamps emerging in the Bay Area, but what makes mine different is that the school is most interested in training students who identify as people of color. I&#39;m thrilled at the opportunity, and I&#39;ve already met people whom I know will be great lifelong friends and collegues. <br /> <br /> I&#39;ll be blogging here about things I learn about coding and general observations about software, engineering, building applications that harness my expertises, and my involvement in the development of a more representative workforce. Thanks for reading!  </p>
