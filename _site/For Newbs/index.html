    <meta name="description" content="As a recent newb to computer programming, I have been told that the resources and links that I can provide or describe personally are of more value to other new programmers than those provided by expert or experienced programmers. I have spent hours staring at blogposts written by experts which are full or jargon, that make many assumptions about their reader&#39;s level of knowledge, and are unhelpful to people starting out. I have sent out this list below in email form to my friends who have approached me on the topic of getting started as a programmer, so here is a curated list for that hope to learn more!  One of the first and best steps to take is the sign up for the  Odin Project (1) . This comprehensive guide goes through everything you will need to be a rails focused developer, including installing and using  Rails ,  Heroku , starting a  Github account . I would recommend doing steps 1-2 and if you still feel excited, keeping going, however, if you are interested in JS specifically, I would continue down my list at this point.   If this went well, I would recommend trying to work through  Code Academy (2) , which teaches great tutorials for people starting a language for the first time.   I focused primarily on JavaScript, the language of the web, and found  JavaScript for Cats (3)  to be helpful and concise. I then began reading  Eloquent JavaScript (4)  as part of a process for applying for JavaScript specific bootcamps in the Bay Area. Another big part of the process was  Coderbyte challenges (5)  and  JavaScript KOANS (6) .   If you&#39;ve been able to absorb and complete most of this information, I&#39;d say you are probably ready to apply for a bootcamp. I told myself I needed more time, and proceeded to use paid resources before I would apply, but if you find these resources helpful enough, I think some people have been able to find work just by using these resources. I still have active accounts and use  Tree House (7)  and  CodeSchool (8) , which are very great to use together and for beginning frameworks and learning about dev tools. By the way, if all of this seems like a lot of different accounts, I will mention that I ended up using a password manager for the first time following this process.   In addition, reading has been helpful. I have read the Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja (9) and other works by  John Resig , and have started on the tome of  JavaScript for Web Developers (10) , but above all else, I highly recommend the  You Don&#39;t Know JS (11+)  series of books. They are really fun to read and really say different information about the topic. I plan to re-read this series once I&#39;m out of TGA.   To also begin the process with HTML and CSS prowess, I would highly recommend setting up your own  personal website , and portfolio websites and applications, showcasing all the things you like and possibly you could incorporate what you used to do before you decided to become a developer. The last thing I wanted to mention is try to find friends and mentors who have taken this path, and seek their advice. I&#39;ve had some friends go through the process recently and they were instrumental getting me here. Hope this was helpful!  #TLDR - List of Resources: JavaScript FocusedOdin ProjectCode AcademyJavaScript for CatsEloquent JavaScriptCoderbyte challengesJavaScript KOANSTree HouseCodeSchoolJavaScript NinjaJavaScript for Web DevelopersYou Don&#39;t Know JS
