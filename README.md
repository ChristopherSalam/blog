This is a blog site I'm constructing as I embark into work as a software engineer. I've used this shell to construct a personal website, which has been moved to chrissalam.com.

Things to get to next:

Blogging about ice and rocks, the ultimate we-hate-interviewing-new-engineers question.

Email parseing and window.atob()

Starting a new job
