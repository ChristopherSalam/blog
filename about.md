My name is Christopher Salam, and I am an Environmental, Chemical, Agricultural, and Software Engineer. I'm interested in technologies and software that help the environment and enable local access to resources. This blogspace will discuss my venture into software which has been largely self-taught and with my partner <a href="http://www.amyyoshitsu.com" target="_blank">Amy Yoshitsu</a>. Her freelance business and the work she has been able to accomplish without prior training has been an inspiration for me. I am in the first class of Telegraph Academy, which is an accelerated JavaScript course for web developers in Berkeley, CA.
