My name is Christopher Salam, and I am an engineer and developer with experience in the energy and agricultural sectors. I'm interested in technologies and software that better the environment and enable local access to resources. I have worked as a freelance web developer with my partner <a href="http://www.amyyoshitsu.com" target="_blank">Amy Yoshitsu</a>, and I am in the first class of Telegraph Academy, which is an accelerated JavaScript course in Berkeley, CA.
