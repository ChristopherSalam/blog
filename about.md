My name is Christopher Salam and I am a software engineer. 

I was in the first cohort of <a href="http://www.telegraphacademy.com/">Telegraph Academy </a>, an amazing accelerated JavaScript immersive for underrepresented minorities in Berkeley, CA.

I work as a freelance developer with <a href="http://www.amyyoshitsu.com" target="_blank">Amy Yoshitsu</a>.

I blog about my interests at <a href="http://chrissalam.com"> chrissalam.com </a>
