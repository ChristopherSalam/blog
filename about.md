Some information about you!

### More Information

My name is Christopher Salam, and I am an Environmental, Chemical, Agricultural, and Software engineer. I'm interested in technologies and software that help the environment and enable local resource use. This blogspace discusses my venture into software which has been largely self-taught and in partnership with Amy Yoshitsu, a graphic and web designer and my future wife. I am in the process of attending the first class of Telegraph Academy, which is an accelerated JavaScript course for web developers in Berkeley, CA.
