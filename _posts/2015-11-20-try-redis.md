Redis, or Remote Dictionary Server, is something that has intrigued me since my first small project in TGA. I built a simple website called Receptacle that used data stored nested at only one level, i.e. key value pairs for keeping track of what kind of bins different kinds of recyclables and wastes get placed into.
