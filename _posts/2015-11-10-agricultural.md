I did a degree in Agricultural Engineering, now called Biological Systems Engineering, at UC Davis from 2007-2011, mostly because I was interested in working with **<a href="http://www.cleanworld.com/our-team/">Dr. Ruihong Zhang</a>**, and her experience and research interests in anaerobic digestion of industrial and agricultural waste. We worked on a project in turkey waste digestion, in partnership with Cargill International, one of the largest meat and agricultural processing companies globally, and the results of the study are **<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhDT.......144S">here</a>**. In the end the project ended up giving Cargill the information to setup digesters at their processing facilities, potentially setting up a new diversion path for untold millions of gallons of waste.

I also had the opportunity to work **<a href="http://www.rcmdigesters.com/about-us/team/">RCM digesters</a>** from 2013-2014. RCM Digesters built manure digesters at Cow, Pig, and Chicken farms. I was able to apply a bit of my research and education here, as well as learn alot about Agriculture and Business in general. I worked on five projects, in Minnesota, Massachusetts, Upstate New York, and in North Eastern Australia. I worked on a very specific part of the anaerobic digestion process called hydrogen sulfide scrubbing, a process of removing a compound that is a trace part of the output of the digester, H2S, a chemical that can cause engine damage and is unsafe to inhale (but no where near the quantity that I experienced in **<a href="http://chrissalam.com/chemical">Chemical Engineering</a>**).

Both of these experiences were particularly humorous to me as a vegetarian, but secretly I do appreciate the consumption of these goods providing me a job, even if I did find it pretty gnarly and unappetizing.

In this space, I wanted to mention that there are a bunch of really cool and strange hackathon opportunities. I follow the **<a href="http://www.apps-for-ag.com/">Aps for Ag hackathon</a>** and attended a recent event in **<a href="http://kvpr.org/post/farmers-turn-tinder-app-inspiration">Coalinga</a>**, and will attend the upcoming event in Davis. Come with me if you are interested! There are not a lot of developers in the agricultural space and it's an area ripe for simple software solutions.
