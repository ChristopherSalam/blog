Tape testing is hella boss! Tape testing in React Native works like a dream. Well...
more like a dream in the way that Inception was a dream. There are some constant asychronous issues but it was for us one of the best ways to test our application. I recommend it as a way to get testing into your React Native pages. I didn't really try Jest, but others in our group did for React and expressed that it was difficult. I will attempt to take a look at Jest before finally writing it off.
