Tonight, I watched Cassandra's talk on functional programming, and I got pretty excited about currying, composing, and piping functions. I wanted to live code some practical examples, as I must admit it took seeing this several times for me to really wrap my head around this topic and I hope this helps!

I would recommend going to Ramda.js's website and pulling up a console there. Another option would be to npm install ramda and try these functions there. If you use sublime and do not have a JS build system, try this link from my classmate <a href="http://jdlawrence.github.io/javascript/closures/2015/08/03/console-inside-sublime-text.html">Jamil</a>. You can also grab it from CDN via

```html
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ramda/0.17.1/ramda.min.js"></script>
```
 Currying is a transformation you can do to allow functions to take their some of their arguments at different times. Currying lets us partially fill the functions and keep them in position for later.

```javascript
function area(height, width) { return height * width; }
var curryArea = R.curry(area);

curryArea(2);    // [function]
curryArea(2)(5); // 10

```
Why is this useful?

```javascript
function that invokes
var lines = R.invoker(1, 'split')('/n');
var split = R.split('/n');
```
var getItems = R.compose(
  R.filter(R.propEq('eventType',"ITEM_DESTROYED")),
  R.flatten,
  R.map(R.prop('events'))
)

<!-- Anyways, we had a toy problem earlier in the program that asked us to write the functions for piping and composing functions. A pipe function asked us to create a function such that

```javascript
var newfunc =  R.pipe(func1, func2, func3)
```

where the newfunc(args_provided_to_function_one) =

True to my nature, if you look closely I'm hugging that tree there.

<!--no I am not jealous-->

Here's my little hug to you, console users: I've learned after doing data transforms in the console that you can save the data object or array as a global variable and then to copy the temporary variable.

```javascript
/*in console*/
Data Object = {...};
            // right click on the edge of the Object
            // store as a temporary variable
            // creates 'temp1'
copy(temp1) // and then run this command
            // to make this is available for
            // pasting in text editor.
```

But this post is mostly about solving trees. which seems to be a very big obsession with the computer science interviewers. I'll try my best to talk myself into understanding trees, breath first search, depth first search, and binary trees.

```javascript
//Prototypal instantiation
function Node (value) {
    //made alternatively by using 'new'
  var obj = Object.create(Node.prototype);
  obj.value = value;
  obj.parent = null;
  obj.children = [];
    //made alternatively by using 'new'
  return obj;
};

function Tree (value) {
    //made alternatively by using 'new'
   var obj = Object.create(Tree.prototype);
   this._root =  new Node(value);
    //made alternatively by using 'new'
   return obj
};
```

I'm going to focus on psuedo-classical just because it's a bit less text, but prototypal shows what's going on under the hood. Also, it would allow us to not use the new keyword, which creates the two lines I've indicated in comments.

```javascript
//Psuedo-classical instantiation
function Node (value) {
  this.value = value;
  this.parent = null;
  this.children = [];
};

function Tree (value) {
  this._root = new Node(value);
};
```

One quick and dirty way to add a child was this I wrote immediately. Also does anyone else hate the mixed metaphor or tree, leaves, children, and parents?

```javascript
Tree.prototype.addChild = function (value) {
  this.children.push(new Tree(value));
};
```

Which works! For sure. The problem with this script is that it's not very elegant in that you have to nest adding children outside the the bast root.

For example:

```javascript
var tree = Tree(0);
tree.addChild(1);
tree.addChild(2);
```

Which works but what if you wanted to into the next level of the tree?

```javascript
var tree = Tree(0);
tree.addChild(1);
tree.addChild(2);
tree.child[0].addChild(1);
tree.child[1].addChild(2);
```

Which we can all agree, isn't great. Why does a tree have siblings or children? There are a few things that need to happen next. One is the concept of checking to see if the tree we have contains the value we need it to contain. This involves traversing through the tree and looking for item at every spot. I immediately drew up this function when first given the task:

```javascript
// Depth First, Initial Attempt
Tree.prototype.contains = function (value) {
  if (this.value === value) {
    return true;
  } else if (this.children !== null) {
    var result = false, i;
    for (i = 0; result === false && i < this.children.length; i++) {
      result = this.children[i].contains(value);
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```

This is a depth first contains check. A depth first search looks at each node and traverses until the most extreme point in each branch before continuing to search up the tree. A breadth first search would conversely look at each level whether or not it was an extreme end or not before continuing deeper in the tree. There is a way to write contains as a method that will either be depth first or breadth first. I first wrote this function when defining a depth first traverse:

```javascript
// Depth First, Initial Attempt
Tree.prototype.traverse = function(callback) {
   callback.call(this, this.value);
   var i;
   for (i = 0; i < this.children.length; i++) {
     this.children[i].traverse(callback);
   }
}
```
While this is an effective and less expensive method of depth first traversing, the recursive method is often described instead, because it makes it more clear the step by step approach of traveling through to the extrema before moving back up the tree.

We should be following four clear steps for a depth first traversal (<a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/data-structures-with-javascript-tree--cms-23393">taken from codetuts</a>):

Step 1. Immediately invoke recurse with the root node of a tree as its argument. At this moment, currentNode points to the current node.
Step 2. Enter a for loop and iterate once for each child of currentNode, beginning with the first child.
Step 3. Inside the body of the for loop, invoke recurse with a child of currentNode. The exact child depends on the current iteration of the for loop.
Step 4. When currentNode no longer has children, we exit the for loop and invoke the callback we passed during the invocation of traverseDF(callback).

```javascript
Tree.prototype.traverseDF = function(callback) {
   // this is a recurse and immediately-invoking function
   (function recurse(currentNode) {
       // step 2
       for (var i = 0, length = currentNode.children.length; i < length; i++) {
           // step 3
           recurse(currentNode.children[i]);
       }
       // step 4
       callback(currentNode);
       // step 1
   })(this._root);
};
```

Let this sink in forever. My version of figuring out breadth first traversal was pretty much the same as the one with a document root.

```javascript
// Breadth First, Initial Attempt
Tree.prototype.traverse = function(callback) {
 var queue = [this],
 current = queue.shift();
   while (current) {
     for (var i = 0; i < current.children.length; i++) {
       queue.push(current.children[i]);
     }
     callback.call(current, current.value);
     current = queue.shift();
   }
}

Tree.prototype.traverseBF = function(callback) {
   var queue = [this._root];
   currentTree = queue.shift();
   while(currentTree){
       for (var i = 0, length = currentTree.children.length; i < length; i++) {
           queue.push(currentTree.children[i]);
       }
       callback(currentTree);
       currentTree = queue.shift();
   }
};
```

Writing out both these traversal techniques finally let us call contains with either kind of traversal. This is a pretty simple process.

```javascript
//
Tree.prototype.contains = function(callback, bfdf) {
   bfdf.call(this, callback);
};
```

Now we can use either method of traversal to create a way to calculate the size of our tree. Super straightforward traversal with callback that counts.

```javascript
Tree.prototype.size = function() {
 var size = 0;
 this.traverseDF(function(){
   size++;
 })
 return size;
}
```
Adding, and subsequently removing are the real pieces to a non-binary tree structure. Adding correctly to a certain value assumes that there are only one or two equal values within the tree and that using either breadth or depth first traversal will get to the desired node. Additionally both add and remove change the tree structure to accommodate the added or removed value value. At point where the data was added or removed, the child needs to be changed, when added, a new tree of data, complete with parent and children needed to be declared, and the parent of the children need to be changed. Lots of logic!

```javascript
Tree.prototype.add = function(value, atValue, bfdf) {
 var child = new Tree(value),
   parent = null,
   callback = function(node) {
     if (node.value === atValue) {
       parent = node;
     }
   };
 this.contains(callback, bfdf);
 if (parent) {
   parent.children.push(child);
   child.parent = parent;
 }
}

Tree.prototype.remove = function(data, fromData, bfdf) {

function findIndex(arr, data) {
   var index;

   for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
       if (arr[i].data === data) {
           index = i;
       }
   }

   return index;
}

   var tree = this,
       parent = null,
       childToRemove = null,
       index;

   var callback = function(node) {
       if (node.data === fromData) {
           parent = node;
       }
   };

   this.contains(callback, bfdf);

   if (parent) {
       index = findIndex(parent.children, data);

       if (index === undefined) {
           throw new Error('Node to remove does not exist.');
       } else {
           childToRemove = parent.children.splice(index, 1);
       }
   } else {
       throw new Error('Parent does not exist.');
   }

   return childToRemove;
};

```
This is my entire testing structure. You can see the add and the addChild functions juxtaposed.

```javascript
var tree = new Tree(0);
tree.add(1, 0, tree.traverseDF);
tree.add(2, 0, tree.traverseDF);
// tree.addChild(1);
// tree.addChild(2);
// tree.children[0].addChild(3);
tree.add(3, 1, tree.traverseDF);
// tree.add(3,1,tree.BFtraverse);
// tree.children[0].children[0].addChild(4);
tree.add(4, 3, tree.traverseDF);
tree.add(5, 2, tree.traverseBF);
tree.remove(5, 2, tree.traverseBF);
console.log(tree);
```
<!--
```javascript
// tree.children[1].children[0].addChild(7);
// console.log(tree.contains(console.log,tree.DFtraverse)); // yields 'true'
// console.log(tree.contains(0)); // yields 'true'
// console.log(tree.contains(1)); // yields 'true'
// console.log(tree.contains(4)); // yields 'false'
// console.log("Depth");
// tree.DFtraverse(console.log);
// console.log("Breadth");
// tree.BFtraverse(console.log);
console.log(tree.size());
```
