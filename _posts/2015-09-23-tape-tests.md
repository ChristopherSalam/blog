Tape testing is hella boss! Tape testing in React Native works like a dream. Well...
more like a dream in the way that Inception was a dream. There are some constant asychronous issues but it was for us one of the best ways to test our application. I recommend it as a way to get testing into your React Native pages.

Tape uses the TAP method of outputing testing information. This is a standard rubric sort of for what information should be in tests and should not be in tests. Tape can be included in your files with a require statement. 

**This is a stub... there's more to come**
