As is customary for those seeking jobs, intimidation involving the binary search tree (BST) is a given. Don't give in! It's a really fun structure and the same recursive reasoning driving linked lists lives here. Grab this set of problems by its occasionally equally spaced branches!

```javascript
//Psuedo-classical instantiation
function Node (value) {
  this.value = value || null;
  this.left = null;
  this.right = null;
};

function BinarySearchTree (value) {
  this.root = null;
};
```

The main difference here is rather than splitting the children into a left and a right (sometimes this is leftChild or rightChild) instead of an array with all the children. You can include a parent here, but I elected not to.

Due to a child limit and the additionally criteria of the value indicating where things go on tree (not true for binary trees). There's not the same level of fuss you had to deal with the tree when it comes to insertion. The value (and the order of insertion) determine it's place on the tree.

```javascript
BinarySearchTree.prototype.push = function(val){

  //this is optional but here
  //we gave the tree the logic
  //to start with null

  var root = this.root;
  if(!root){
    this.root = new Node(val);
    return;
  }

  //if the root already exists
  //lets make the new node.

  var currentNode = root;
  var newNode = new Node(val);

  //here is the logic to place
  //the node in the right spot

  while(currentNode){
    if(val < currentNode.value){
        if(!currentNode.left){
          //(exit step) then
          //changes the null at location
          //we need to the value.
          currentNode.left = newNode;
            break;
        } else {
          //Find the node we need
          currentNode = currentNode.left;
        }
    } else {
      if(!currentNode.right){
        //(other exit step)
        currentNode.right = newNode;
        break;
      } else {
        //Find the node we need
        currentNode = currentNode.right;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Binary-Search-Tree Contains method let's use the structure of the data model to locate the exact node by value. This could be refactored, as it is here, it has some repetition of the logic as above.

```javascript
BinarySearchTree.prototype.contains = function(value, node) {
  // a recursive function that looks at each node
  function contains(value, node) {
    //here's the exit
    if (node === null) { return false; }
    //this is just in case the
    //value is in place as a string
    //ooooo non-typesafe languages
    var nodeValue = parseInt(node.value, 10);
    //check here
      if (value < nodeValue) {
        return contains(value, node.left);
    //check here
      } else if (value > nodeValue) {
        return contains(value, node.right);
    //this is the other exit condition,
    //a found value
      } return true;
  }
  //I wrote this out and it didn't work
  //until I added the return here... doof!
  return contains(value, this.root);
};
```

Traversal in a binary search tree is not recursive, the tree itself allows for log n time processing. We can use this logic to insert nodes as well. This method of inserting does not balance the tree. Balancing the tree is a whole other can of worms, but balancing a tree helps optimize the traversal.

  DepthFirst

  ```javascript
  BinarySearchTree.prototype.depthFirst = function(callback, node){
  //default, in case no node is given
  	  node = node || this.root,
  //named stack just for flavor
  	  stack = [];
  	var traverse = function(node){
  //named to allow for recursion
  		if (node) {
  //each time there's a node,
  //go digging in either direction.
  //you can reverse the order by
  //changing the order here.
  		  stack.push(node.value);
  //if you want a callback
        if (callback) { callback(node.value); }
  //nested traversal happens here.      
  			traverse(node.left);
  			traverse(node.right);
  		}
  	}
  	traverse(node)
  	return stack;
  }
  ```

```javascript
BinarySearchTree.prototype.breadthFirst = function(callback, node) {
      var result = [];
      queue = [],
      node = node || this.root;
    //exit condition
    if (!node) return null;
    //sends the root to the que
    queue.push(node);
    //the queue.shift() sends the next level
    while (node = queue.shift()) {
	//store the node here
	    result.push(node.value);
	//put a callback here
	    if (callback) {callback(node.value); }
	//if the node exists, then queue it
	//and the while loop persists.
	    node.left && queue.push(node.left);
	    node.right && queue.push(node.right);
    } return result;
};
```

Psuedo-Breadth First Recursion style. This example is truly done depth first, but lets you visualize the levels using objects.

```javascript
BinarySearchTree.prototype.breadthFirstRec = function(node) {
  //This is simulating breadth first
  //This method gives you access to
  //depth so you can use that to
  //make path queries.
  node = node || this.root
  var levels = {},
    traverse = function(node, depth) {
      //exit
	    if (!node) { return null; }
      //create data at that level
	    if (!levels[depth]) { levels[depth] = [node.value]; }
      //or add to it
	    else { levels[depth].push(node.value); }
      // *if callback was nested here
      // it would be depth first*
      //traverse as before, with depth accounted for.
	    traverse(node.left, depth + 1);
	    traverse(node.right, depth + 1);
		}
	traverse(node, 0);
  return levels;
};
```

<!-- Least Common Ancestor

```javascript

BinarySearchTree.prototype.getLCA = function(node, a, b){
	if (node === null) { return null; }
	if (node === a || node === b) { return node; }
	left = BinarySearchTree.prototype.getLCA(node.left, a, b);
	right = BinarySearchTree.prototype.getLCA(node.right, a, b);
	if (left !== null && right !== null) { return node; }
	if (left === null) { return right; }
	else { return left; }
}
