I'm pretty new to this game. It's been about 2 years. When people ask me how I arrived at this transition, I tell them that I was heavily inspired by learning Autocad at 28, and by my partner, Amy Yoshitsu, who's also transitioned from Art to Design/Developing. We saw an opportunity to help each other as well as possibly work together someday and it seemed too reasonable to pass up.

So, now I'm here!
