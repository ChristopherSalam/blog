"The two best days are the day you buy a bus and the day you sell a bus."

I thought I would use this space to offer up hints and tips for those who decide to take on owning a party bus.

While owning a bus can be a fun experience, the experience is fraught with risk.

For every simple event with no problems, there are two in which you may in face unique challenges.

The notion of a party bus drives people to behave truly unsafely. Help prevent injury by attaching your spare tire and bicycles securely.

Please make efforts to prevent roof access, and if unavoidable, roof skateboard access.

When choosing bands or DJs, please choose people you know and trust.

Just as in server engineering, load balancing is important. Please have 2-3 independent sources of electricity (please know the wiring diagrams where you are drawing from). You should probably have your own generator if the party is big enough. However, you can likely draw people from bulidings out the party if you blow out their power.

Encourage people to obey maximum occupancy limits.

Also, be sure to make events happen elsewhere, later in the evening.

The police prefer the bus be emptied out later in the evening, move the party inside.

If possible learn to drive ahead of time. Oversteering and planning are a must. Curbs are not obstacles anymore.

Don't learn suddenly because the crazy person who tricked you in buying the bus suddenly vacates the seat and says "you must learn now". However, if this happens, get in the seat, learn quick, and save everyone's life. If you are wondering, we are not friends. Very scary. True story.

Most importantly, have fun. You only get one life.
