This area I've been saving for sundries regarding the console. It's a pretty powerful little area within the browser you can use to access lots of information. Every now and then you'll find yourself making a great discovery in the console and you'll want to grab what you find there and pull it out.

This is a little trick I found deep on Stack Overflow that hopefully they will make more accessible in the future:

```javascript
/*in console*/
Data Object = {...};
            // right click on the edge of the Object
            // store as a temporary variable
            // creates 'temp1'
copy(temp1) // and then run this command
            // to make this is available for
            // pasting in text editor.
```

None of this stuff is mine, but was revealed to me by Scott Moss, our AngularJS lecturer, who must be involved with web standards and gets this information in advance. If you go to the console in chrome, certain methods that aren't common practice are made available.
