**<a href="http://demesheo.github.io/">Demesheo Wilson II</a>** approached me with help on a regexp problem which was a very small part of the for the project his team was working on called **<a href="http://gogitit.co/">Go Git it!</a>**, which keeps track of the JavaScript frameworks people are using. Here's the case he presented to me: how do I read a javascript framework such as react.js from a cdn call in index.html or a package.json?

```html
<script src="react.js"></script>
```
I immediately thought the solution was going to involve a regexp technique I was not that familiar with called lookaheads. Lookaheads are a rarely used feature of the regular expression syntax which match while looking ahead to allow you to remove part of the text from the match.

If you've never used **<a href="http://regexr.com/">regexr</a>**, now's a good time. I'll include some screenshots so we can follow along.

Ideally, we just want the word react from the above sentence. This is what ended up working perfectly:

```javascript
//gets .js including .min.js
/[\w.-]+(?=\.js)/g
```
<img src="final.min.png"/>

Let's through each part one by one.

```javascript
/-----/g
```
Regular Expressions are objects that use the bracket syntax. Anything between these letters is a pattern to match. The g global or g flag says give me all the instances of this match, otherwise we just get the first match.

```javascript
/\w+/g
```
<img src="words.png"/>

\w+ looks for all word like characters, and includes numbers for things like d3. This picks up way too much.

```javascript
/\w+/g
```
<img src="words.png"/>

\w+ looks for all word like characters, and includes numbers for things like d3. This picks up way too much.

```javascript
/\w+\.js/g
-is the same as-
/\w+(\.js)/g
```
<img src="noCapture.png"/>
-is the same as-
<img src="needDash.png"/>

Adding \.js to the Regular Expression does a lot for us. So two big problems to address stick out here. Minified files really throw off this process. Also, dashes need to be addressed. We escape (use \) on the . because . means any character in Regular Expressions, and \. means specifically the . character. Parentheses around the \.js is needed for the lookahead that's coming.

```javascript
/\w+(?=\.js)/g
```
<img src="posLook.png"/>

With this step, we've removed the .js from the back of the files. Now let's address min and dash. We need to use brackets to give us options in addition to \w. Lets get \w, periods, and dashes, and use brackets to allow for all three options. We will place the + sign outside the brackets to allow for any combination of them to be matched.

```javascript
/[\w.-]+(?=\.js)/g
```
<img src="dashesdots.png"/>

That's nearly there! So the rest I'm not sure how Demesheo ended up processing these files, but one approach just grabs the d3 from d3.min.js but misses the js files.

 ```javascript
/[\w-]+(?=\.min\.js)/g
```

Another approach is something you can run on your already matched text to remove the ".min". Don't run this on the whole document because then you'll run into the min.css.

 ```javascript
//removes min
/[\w-]+(?=\.min)/g
 ```

That's all I got on $(this). Regular expressions are pretty powerful things! Hope this was helpful and has some application for you.

**This is a stub... there's more to come**
