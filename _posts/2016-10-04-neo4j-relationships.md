**[Part 1 - Try Neo4j](/try-neo4j "Getting Started")** | **[Part 2 - Query Neo4j](/query-neo4j "Learning Database Language")** | **[Part 3 - Collisions](/collision "Resolving Duplicates")** | **[Part 4 - Node Neo4j](/node-neo4j "The Hard Part!")** | Part 5 | **[Repo](https://github.com/upstanding-biome/sixdegrees)** | **[Site](http://sixdribbles.com)**

Our Neo4j is expanding, so I'll continue to discuss it here. It has been roughly one year since this project made it on to the web, we've renewed our hosting with Graph Story, and we are going to take some Design help from my partner Amy. We may also add features that allow for different kind of relationships in our NBA player ecosystem, such as General Manager, Coach, Assistant Coach, and Players that become these positions.

**This is a stub, there's more coming**
