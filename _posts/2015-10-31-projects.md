Here I will mention my experiences at Telegraph Academy (TGA) and discuss how and why to choose good projects. I made an effort to really mix the technologies and frameworks used and make them interesting.

Your blog and your projects will shape you (after resume on right):

Your projects will determine your skills and both will take up 50% of your resume.

When choosing projects, make sure to have aspects you love about project while also allowing your teammates to have aspects they love. This will guarantee that everyone will work hard and be able to talk about them intelligently.

**"How long have you spent on this... 16 hours? That makes you an expert. When you figure it out, tell me and I'll post your blog."**

Your projects are extremely important and what makes you stand out. Other coding bootcamp students and self-taught programmers often don't have 3-4 projects to show. In addition, some of their best work may be under a Non-disclosure Agreement, your projects will not.

You will become an preeminent expert on certain connections and technologies if you choose to. Developers are too busy with their job to learn new cutting edge technologies or try combinations that aren't traditional. Doing either will make you esteemed within the community and will give you something interesting to talk about. Pay attention to what your classmates do as well, it could be just as important as your own projects.

Most importantly, make sure you love some part of the topic. You will have to talk about these projects over and over and over, so make sure they are about something you care about.
