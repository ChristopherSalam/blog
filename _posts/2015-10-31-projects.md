Here I will mention my experiences at Telegraph Academy (TGA) and discuss how and why to choose good projects. I made an effort to really mix the technologies and frameworks used and make them interesting.

Your blog and your projects will shape you (after resume on right):

When choosing projects, make sure to have aspects you love about project while also allowing your teammates to have aspects they love. This will guarantee that everyone will work hard and be able to talk about them intelligently.

**"How long have you spent on this... 16 hours? That makes you an expert. When you figure it out, tell me and I'll post your blog."**

You will become an preeminent expert on certain connections and technologies if you choose too. Developers are too busy with their job to learn new cutting edge technologies or try combinations that aren't traditional. Doing either will make you esteemed within the community and will give you something interesting to talk about. Pay attention to what your classmates do as well, it could be just as important as your own projects.
