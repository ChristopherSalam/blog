title: Links For Newbs
---

As a recent newb to computer programming, I have been told that the resources and links that I can provide or describe personally are of more value to other new programmers than those provided by expert or experienced programmers. I have spent hours staring at blogposts written by experts which are full or jargon, that make many assumptions about their reader's level of knowledge, and are unhelpful to people starting out. I have sent out this list below in email form to my friends who have approached me on the topic of getting started as a programmer, so here is a curated list for that hope to learn more!<br /> <br /> One of the first and best steps to take is the sign up for the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/"> Odin Project (1) </a>. This comprehensive guide goes through everything you will need to be a rails focused developer, including installing and using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"> Rails </a>, <a href="https://www.heroku.com/"> Heroku </a>, starting a <a href="https://github.com/"> Github account </a>. I would recommend doing steps 1-2 and if you still feel excited, keeping going, however, if you are interested in JS specifically, I would continue down my list at this point. <br /> <br /> If this went well, I would recommend trying to work through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"> Code Academy (2) </a>, which teaches great tutorials for people starting a language for the first time. <br /> <br /> I focused primarily on JavaScript, the language of the web, and found <a href="http://jsforcats.com/"> JavaScript for Cats (3) </a> to be helpful and concise. I then began reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/"> Eloquent JavaScript (4) </a> as part of a process for applying for JavaScript specific bootcamps in the Bay Area. Another big part of the process was <a href="http://coderbyte.com/"> Coderbyte challenges (5) </a> and <a href="http://www.davidlaing.com/2010/07/19/learning-functional-javascript-through-koans/"> JavaScript KOANS (6) </a>. <br /> <br /> If you've been able to absorb and complete most of this information, I'd say you are probably ready to apply for a bootcamp. I told myself I needed more time, and proceeded to use paid resources before I would apply, but if you find these resources helpful enough, I think some people have been able to find work just by using these resources. I still have active accounts and use <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com"> Tree House (7) </a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/"> CodeSchool (8) </a>, which are very great to use together and for beginning frameworks and learning about dev tools. By the way, if all of this seems like a lot of different accounts, I will mention that I ended up using a password manager for the first time following this process. <br /> <br /> In addition, reading has been helpful. I have read the Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja (9) and other works by <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/"> John Resig </a>, and have started on the tome of <a href="http://m.friendfeed-media.com/95a8434720c64a63e96ff8c4364fb595d9e98c36"> JavaScript for Web Developers (10) </a>, but above all else, I highly recommend the <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS"> You Don't Know JS (11-15) </a> series of books. They are really fun to read and really say different information about the topic. I plan to re-read this series once I'm out of TGA. <br /> <br/> To also begin the process with HTML and CSS prowess, I would highly recommend setting up your own <a href="http://chrissalam.com"> personal website </a>, and portfolio websites and applications, showcasing all the things you like and possibly you could incorporate what you used to do before you decided to become a developer. The last thing I wanted to mention is try to find friends and mentors who have taken this path, and seek their advice. I've had some friends go through the process recently and they were instrumental getting me here. Hope this was helpful! <br /><br /> #TLDR - List of Resources: JavaScript Focused<ul><li><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">(1) Odin Project</a></li><li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">(2) Code Academy</a></li><li><a href="http://jsforcats.com/">(3) JavaScript for Cats</a></li><li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">(4) Eloquent JavaScript</a></li><li><a href="http://coderbyte.com/">(5) Coderbyte challenges</a></li><li><a href="http://www.davidlaing.com/2010/07/19/learning-functional-javascript-through-koans/">(6) JavaScript KOANS</a></li><li><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">(7) Tree House</a></li><li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">(8) CodeSchool</a></li><li><a href="http://www.manning.com/resig/">(9) JavaScript Ninja</li></a><li><a href="http://m.friendfeed-media.com/95a8434720c64a63e96ff8c4364fb595d9e98c36">(10) JavaScript for Web Developers</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">(11-15) You Don't Know JS</a></li>
