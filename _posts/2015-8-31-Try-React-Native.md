Our group of three sat down to discuss what we wanted to pursue for our Telegraph Academy senior project. We created a venn diagram and put up our different goals, technology interests, and interests. We discussed our goals for after the program and a few different proposals before settling in on a social app that uses React Native, d3, Firebase, the Facebook API.

Then we thought... can we pull this off in four weeks?

A few days later, the thought is certainly that we definitely can and that we will contribute to the work that will lead to making react native and firebase even more successful. Kent, one of my teammates, already has <a href="http://devdactic.com/react-native-for-beginners/">corrected a blog </a> that we've used and we are going to keep adding to the blog posts and links that have helped us.

Some of the other links that we have used so far.
