Redis, or Remote Dictionary Server, is something that has intrigued me since my first small project in TGA. I built a simple website called Receptacle that used data stored nested at only one level, i.e. key value pairs for keeping track of what kind of bins different kinds of recyclables and wastes get placed into.

As the site is currently constructed, it preloads the entire data set into an angular controller, and lets the information pulled from your waste input (key) turn out a bin location (and soon, addresses or places to take complex wastes such as hard drives, batteries, and lightbulbs) (value)
